## Run application

### In root path of repository

`npm run dev` - will run fronted (client) and backend (server) side for app and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
(TODO - it will be add in future)
`npm test dev` - will run for fronted (client) and backend (server) all available unit tests
(TODO - it will be add in future)
`npm run build` - will build types for fronted (client) and backend (server)

### Server side

`npm run start` - will run backend (server) side for app and open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
`npm run build` - will build types for backend (server)

### Client side

`npm run start` - will run fronted (client) side for app and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
`npm run build` - will build types for fronted (client)

### `npm run eject`

(TODO - read more about this)
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
